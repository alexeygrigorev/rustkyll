# Development Process

## Overview

We use file-based issue tracking in `docs/tracker/`. Four agents handle the lifecycle: PM grooms, Engineer implements, Tester verifies, PM accepts.

Terminology:
- Issue = a file in `docs/tracker/` describing work to be done (bug fix, feature, etc.)
- Task = a Claude Code task panel item tracking pipeline steps within the current session

## Issue Lifecycle

```
PM grooms (.todo)  ->  Engineer builds (.in-progress)  ->  Tester verifies  ->  PM accepts (.done)
```

### File-Based Status

Issue status is encoded in the filename:

| Status | Filename Pattern | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Todo | `01-name.todo.md` | Not started, needs PM grooming before pickup |
| Groomed | `01-name.groomed.md` | PM has groomed, ready for engineer |
| In Progress | `01-name.in-progress.md` | Engineer is working on it |
| Done | `01-name.done.md` | PM accepted, complete |

### Status Transitions

```
.todo.md  -->  PM grooms  -->  .groomed.md  -->  Engineer picks up  -->  .in-progress.md
                                                      |
                                              Engineer done + Tester pass + PM accept
                                                      |
                                                      v
                                                 .done.md
```

## Agent Workflow

The orchestrator (top-level Claude Code session) drives the process:

1. PM Grooms: Pick `.todo.md` issues, add acceptance criteria and test scenarios, rename to `.groomed.md`
2. Pick 2 issues: Select the lowest-numbered `.groomed.md` issues whose dependencies are met
3. Engineer implements: Write code + tests, rename to `.in-progress.md`
4. Tester reviews: Run tests, verify acceptance criteria, report pass/fail
5. If fail: Engineer fixes, tester re-reviews (repeat)
6. If pass: PM does acceptance review
7. If PM rejects: Engineer fixes, PM re-reviews
8. If PM accepts: Rename to `.done.md`, commit
9. Pick next 2 issues and repeat

## Agents

| Agent | File | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Product Manager | `.claude/agents/product-manager.md` | Grooms issues + final acceptance |
| Software Engineer | `.claude/agents/software-engineer.md` | Implements code + tests |
| Tester | `.claude/agents/tester.md` | Runs tests, verifies acceptance criteria |

## Technology Stack

- Language: Rust (latest stable)
- Build system: Cargo
- Testing: `cargo test`
- Linting: `cargo clippy`
- Formatting: `cargo fmt`

## How to Pick Issues

1. List `.groomed.md` files in `docs/tracker/`
2. Pick the lowest-numbered issues first (lower = more foundational)
3. Check dependencies -- don't start until deps are `.done.md`
4. Pick 2 independent issues at a time for parallel implementation

## Output Verification (Critical)

For any issue that changes HTML output or templating:

1. Build the site and verify the generated HTML is correct
2. Check that links, images, and structured data are properly rendered
3. Compare output against the original Jekyll site where applicable
4. Verify RSS/Atom feeds are valid XML

### Common output issues to check:
- Broken links or missing images
- Malformed HTML (unclosed tags, wrong nesting)
- Missing or incorrect metadata (Open Graph, structured data)
- Incorrect URL generation or permalink structure
- Missing content from collections (posts, books, podcast, etc.)

## Task Panel (Claude Code Built-in Tasks)

The orchestrator MUST use the Claude Code task panel to track every step of the pipeline. Tasks are session-scoped progress trackers -- they are NOT the same as issues in `docs/tracker/`.

### How Task Panel Items Should Look

Each task panel item tracks a pipeline step for a batch of issues:

| Task Subject | Example |
|---|---|
| `[PM groom] issues #59, #60` | PM grooming step |
| `[SWE] implement issues #59, #60` | Engineering step |
| `[QA] verify issues #59, #60` | Testing step |
| `[PM accept] issues #59, #60` | Acceptance + commit step |
| `[Pull next] pick 2 issues from backlog` | Pick up more work |

### Setting Up a Batch

When starting work on a batch of issues, create task panel items for the full pipeline:

1. `[PM groom] issues #N, #M`
2. `[SWE] implement issues #N, #M`
3. `[QA] verify issues #N, #M`
4. `[PM accept] issues #N, #M -> commit`
5. `[Pull next] pick 2 issues from backlog`

Set up blockedBy dependencies so each step waits for the previous one. Mark each item `in_progress` when starting it and `completed` when done.

### Pipeline Per Batch

```
[PM groom] -> [SWE] Implement -> [QA] Test -> [PM accept] -> Commit -> [Pull next]
                  ^                              |
                  +---- Reject (back to SWE) ----+
```

### Task Panel Tags

| Panel Tag | Agent | When | What happens |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|
| `[PM groom]` | Product Manager | BEFORE implementation | Adds acceptance criteria, test scenarios. Renames .todo -> .groomed |
| `[SWE]` | Software Engineer | After grooming | Implements code + tests. Renames .groomed -> .in-progress |
| `[QA]` | Tester | After implementation | Verifies acceptance criteria, builds site and checks output. Pass/Fail |
| `[PM accept]` | Product Manager | AFTER QA passes | Final review. Builds and inspects output. Accept -> .done + commit. Reject -> back to SWE to finish |
| `[Pull next]` | Orchestrator | AFTER commit | Check docs/tracker/ for remaining .todo/.groomed files. Pick 2 lowest-numbered, create new batch in task panel, repeat |

PM has two distinct roles:
1. Before engineering: groom the issue (define what "done" looks like)
2. After QA: accept or reject (verify it actually looks right). Reject sends it back to engineer for finishing, NOT back to grooming.

### Pull Next Work

The last item in every batch is always "[Pull next] pick 2 issues from backlog". This ensures work continues automatically:
1. Check `docs/tracker/` for `.todo.md` or `.groomed.md` files
2. Pick the 2 lowest-numbered groomed issues (groom first if only .todo.md)
3. Create a new batch of task panel items with dependencies
4. Start the pipeline again

## Conventions

- Every issue must include tests (`cargo test`)
- Lint with `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- Format with `cargo fmt`
- Commit message references issue: "Implement issue 01: project setup"
- Only commit after PM accepts
- Issues are NEVER deleted -- they move through statuses (.todo -> .groomed -> .in-progress -> .done)
- Commit regularly -- don't accumulate large uncommitted changes
